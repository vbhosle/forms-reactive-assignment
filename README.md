# Angular 6: Reactive forms assignment
Create a Form with the following Controls and Validators

1. Project Name (should not be empty)
2. Mail (should not be a empty and a valid email)
3. Project Status Dropdown, with three values: 'Stable', 'Critical', 'Finished'
4. Submit Button

* Add your own Validator which doesn't allow "Test" as a Project Name
* Also implement that Validator as an async Validator (replace the other one)
* Upon submitting the form, simply print the value to the console
